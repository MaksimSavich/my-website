          This project was created as a rewrite for a pre-existing discord attendance recording bot for a solar racing club I am a part of. The previous bot was very simple and had bugs. I decided to rewrite the bot using Python and the Discord.py library. It also utilized the Pandas library to handle dataframes and save them to CSV files so that they can be saved in the discord guild.
